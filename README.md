## Folder structure
`/components`: General client components, that can be reused

`/enums`: All general and global enums that we use. Not general enums belong in the modules folder!

`/icons`: Obvious i think. Just add another icon as React component and add the import to the /icons/index.ts

`/lib`: Not important for general development. Just libary setup

`/locales`: Here are the text snippets: German and English

`/modules`: Modules of our application

`/pages`: Pages that just represent the routes

`/public`: In this folder only the assets are important. Add a new assets and restart the server

`/store`: The code here stores our data. We use the libary Zustand for that
